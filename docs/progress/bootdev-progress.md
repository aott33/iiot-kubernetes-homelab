## Why Boot.dev?

I'm using the Boot.dev curriculum to build a strong foundation in backend development and cloud-native technologies, which directly supports this IIoT homelab project:

- **Go Programming** - Core language for services in this project
- **Docker & Kubernetes** - Container orchestration used throughout
- **HTTP & APIs** - RESTful APIs for platform integration
- **SQL & Databases** - Time-series and relational data storage
- **Security** - Critical for OT/IT network segmentation
- **CI/CD** - Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Project Alignment

This homelab serves as my capstone-style project, applying Boot.dev concepts in a real production-like environment:

1. **Network Security** (Learn Web Security) - OT/IT VLAN segmentation, firewall rules
2. **Container Orchestration** (Learn Kubernetes, Learn Docker) - K3s cluster management
3. **Backend Services** (Learn Golang, Learn HTTP) - Custom Go services for data processing
4. **Database Design** (Learn SQL) - Time-series databases for sensor data
5. **Pub/Sub Architecture** (Learn Pub/Sub) - MQTT Sparkplug B protocol implementation
